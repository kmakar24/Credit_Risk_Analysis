# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
We use our new knowlage of machine learning to help dive into the real world problem of credit card risk.  We will use machine learning to help predit credit card risk, this is a perfect use of machine learning because it has unbalanced classification problem (good loans significantly outnumber risk loans) so we will have plenty of opportunities to test out our newly learned skills. 
### Libraries Used: 
- imbalanced-learn
- scikit-learn
### Machine Learning Models Used: 
1. Random Over Sampler
2. SMOTE
3. Cluster Centroids
4. SMOTEENN
5. Balanced Random Forest Classifier 
6. Easy Ensemble Classifier

## Results 
### Random Over Sampler
